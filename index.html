		<p> Germany dominanted Brazil in Brazil on tuesday. The 7-1 victory has sent the German side into the World Cup final against the victor of Wednesday's matchup between Argentina and Netherlands. </p>

		<p> The Brazil side often seemed disorganized and sometimes even ambivalent. They were without their national hero, Neymar, and their team captain, Thiago Silva. Brazil simply did not come to play as they fell into an insurmountable early hole. Toni Kroos played especially well for Germany scoring 2 goals. Also, Miroslav Klose broke the World Cup career scoring record with a first half goal.  </p>

		<p> In tomorrow's match, I expect Argentina to win on penalty kicks after a scoreless draw. In a Germany-Argentina matchup, I would hope Argentina would win while believing that Germany is the better team </p>
